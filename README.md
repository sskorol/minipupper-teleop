### MiniPupper Teleop

This project allows streaming video from [MiniPupper]() via WebRTC and teleoperate it via ROS. Note that the [MiniPupper Backend]() assumes you've already mounted [oak-d lite]() camera on your robot. If you don't have one yet, you can still teleoperate the robot via keyboard, but w/o camera stream.
